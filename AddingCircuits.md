Each of the circuits share a common structure, making it possible to easily add them to the app, 
& hence allowing collaborative updates of the app's database ;p

The said-strucure is composed of 2 or more files:
- an /SVG file which contains the schematic
- a .json file holding settings & stuff that works together with the SVG
- an optional .js file which may be used to write helpers to be used for the calculation fcn



Example of said-files ( nb: click it to view correctly - no boundrect is defined ;p )
